# Robot Arm Control

# Credits
I used [this blog post](https://auth0.com/blog/using-python-flask-and-angular-to-build-modern-apps-part-1/) as a base to get started. It's really awesome and well explained. Reading it is strongly recommended if you're interested in how this works

# Requirements
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm
sudo npm install -g @angular/cli
```
I had to run this 3 times to get it up to date but, that might be just me... Normally, it's just twice :)
```
sudo npm install -g npm
```

# Running the project
```
python3 ./backend/server.py
./frontend/ng serve 
```
